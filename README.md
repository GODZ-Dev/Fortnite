# Fortnite

Epic Games' smash hit, Fortnite, is a must to study from. In this reposity, we explore recreating the popular Battle Royal game using the Unreal Engine. The code will be acompanied by a video series where I take you step-by-step through building themechanics yourself. Videos will be uploaded regularly to [my YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/GameCatalyst) as they are completed.

## Video List
Currently empty! Don't worry though, there should be a new video soon.

## Built With

[Unreal Engine 4.18](https://www.unrealengine.com)
* Once you install the Epic Games Launcher, you can manually select the correct engine version and download it if version 4.19+is already released. I don't suggest using it with other versions, but it is possible to upgrade. Just be wary that some code may break and require debugging.

## Versioning

I like to use the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) system for my projects. To view the different versions, check out [my code releases](https://github.com/GameCatalyst/Fortnite/releases).
